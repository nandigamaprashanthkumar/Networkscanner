Whether you are a network administrator, security professional, or enthusiast, this tool simplifies the process of scanning and analyzing networks, aiding in the identification of potential vulnerabilities and optimizing resource allocation.

**Key Features:**

1. **Host Discovery:**
   - Quickly identify active hosts on the network, allowing administrators to understand the topology and ensure all devices are accounted for.

2. **Port Scanning:**
   - Perform efficient port scans to discover open ports on target devices. Identify potential entry points for enhanced security assessment.

3. **Service Enumeration:**
   - Gather detailed information about services running on open ports, providing insights into the software and protocols in use.

4. **Network Asset Identification:**
   - Automatically detect and classify network devices, including routers, switches, and connected endpoints, for a comprehensive view of the network landscape.

5. **Customizable Scan Parameters:**
   - Tailor scans based on specific criteria, such as IP ranges, port ranges, or scan types, allowing flexibility for various network assessment scenarios.

6. **Detailed Scan Reports:**
   - Receive detailed reports summarizing scan results, aiding administrators in making informed decisions for network optimization and security enhancement.

**Use Cases:**

- **Network Health Check:**
  Conduct routine scans to ensure the health and functionality of network devices, identifying potential issues before they escalate.

- **Security Audits:**
  Perform security assessments to identify vulnerabilities and potential entry points for malicious activities. Strengthen the network against potential threats.

- **Resource Planning:**
  Optimize resource allocation by understanding device distribution and load across the network, facilitating strategic decisions for improved performance.

**How to Use:**

1. **Input Network Details:**
   - Specify the target network or IP range for scanning.

2. **Configure Scan Parameters:**
   - Customize scan parameters based on the desired scope and depth of the scan.

3. **Initiate Scan:**
   - Launch the scan and monitor progress in real-time.

4. **Review Results:**
   - Access detailed scan reports to review identified hosts, open ports, and service information.

**Note:**
The Network Scanner Tool is a valuable asset for network administrators, security professionals, and anyone seeking to enhance their understanding of network environments. Always ensure proper authorization before conducting scans on any network.
The error you're encountering suggests that the Python interpreter is unable to find the specified Python script at the given file path. The error message indicates that there might be a typo or a discrepancy in the file path.
===

===
Here are a few things to check and address:

1. **Check File Path:**
   Double-check the file path and ensure that it is correct. Make sure there are no typos or extra spaces. In your case, it seems there might be an extra 'k' in "netwrokscanner.py." Correct the file name to "networkscanner.py" if that's the intended name.

2. **Use Correct Backslashes:**
   Ensure that you're using double backslashes (`\\`) or single forward slashes (`/`) in the file path. Python can interpret both, but using double backslashes is a common practice on Windows.

   Example:
   ```bash
   C:\\Users\\Chloe Johnson\\Documents\\Networkscanner\\networkscanner.py
   ```

3. **Navigate to the Correct Directory:**
   Open a command prompt or terminal, navigate to the directory where your Python script is located, and then run the script. You can use the `cd` command to change directories.

   Example:
   ```bash
   cd C:\Users\Chloe Johnson\Documents\Networkscanner
   C:\Python312\python.exe networkscanner.py
   ```

4. **Check Python Version:**
   Ensure that your Python version is correctly installed, and the `python.exe` path is accurate. The specified path in your error message looks correct (`C:\Python312\python.exe`), but double-check to make sure Python is installed at that location.

After addressing these points, you should be able to run your Python script without encountering the "No such file or directory" error. If the issue persists, please provide more details about your file structure and the exact command you're using to run the script.
